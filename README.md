# Project Description
This project showcases the design and implementation of a Data Analytics Platform on AWS for the City of Vancouver (COV). The platform will be used to perform descriptive analysis, starting from data ingestion, processing, analytics, storage, and data summarization, leveraging AWS solutions offered through the AWS console. Additionally, the DAP is expected to leverage key attributes of the AWS space, such as dynamic scalability, availability, and self-tailored cost-effectiveness and efficiency.
