# Project Title: Design and Implementation of DAP on AWS for the City of Vancouver

## 🗂️ Project Description
This project showcases the design and implementation of a Data Analytics Platform on AWS for the City of Vancouver (COV). The platform will be used to perform descriptive analysis, starting from data ingestion, processing, analytics, storage, and data summarization, leveraging AWS solutions offered through the AWS console. Additionally, the DAP is expected to leverage key attributes of the AWS space, such as dynamic scalability, availability, and self-tailored cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

## 🔷 Methodology

i.	Design:  The DAP was designed as requested using Draw.io 

ii.	Data Ingestion: The subject data [City of Vancouver's Workforce Pay Rates and Sex (WPRS)] was ingested into the AWS S3 Raw bucket directly.

iii.	Data Profiling: This ingested dataset (WPRS) was profiled using AWS Glue DataBrew.

iv.	Data Cleaning: The phase transforms the profiled dataset from dirty to clean by removing any errors, such as missing or duplicate data, and structural issues. Output is saved in the AWS S3 Transform Bucket.

v.	Data Catalog:  Using Crawler on AWS Data Glue, a data catalog comprising schema and table location was created for the WPRS dataset to aid connectivity and data analytics.

vi.	Data Summarization: The dataset is summarized using metrics created in AWS Glue and stored in a system-friendly format with multiple partitions and a user-friendly format in a single file in AWS S3 Curated Bucket.

# Data Analytics Platform
## 📌 Objective
To design and implement DAP to support COV’s migration initiative to AWS
## 📊 Descriptive Analysis
Question: What is the average minimum and maximum hourly pay rate for each City of Vancouver’s Job classification?
## 📋 Dataset Overview
The dataset was extracted from City of Vancouver's Open Data Source (2025). It represents a breakdown of the city’s workforce Pay Rates based on the below columns including the male and the female sex designation. It includes 598 rows and 10 columns of data extracted from 2019 to the 2023 City of Vancouver Workforce Payrate information as shown in Table 1:

### Table 1
### 🏷️ Key Columns

| Column              | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Year`              | Data ranges from **2019 to 2023**          |
| `ExemptUnion`       | Contains 7 different values (e.g., CUPE 15, Exempt) |
| `Classification`    | 68 different job classifications              |
| `PositionTitle`     | 152 different job titles                      |
| `DataCategory`      | Always "Detail"     |
| `MinimumHourlyRate` | Min: \$0.01, Max: \$75.31, Mean: \$35.18   |
| `MaximumHourlyRate` | Min: \$0.01, Max: \$82.92, Mean: \$40.52   |
| `Female`            | Employee count within each row; Ranges from 0 to 214     |
| `Male`              | Employee count within each row; Ranges from 0 to 561                       |
| `Total`             | Employee count within each row; Ranges from 10 to 584 (sum of Male + Female) |

## 🧩 DAP Design and Implementation
Draw.io was used to illustrate the cloud-based Data Analytics Platform (DAP) built on AWS, optimized for analyzing  COV’s workforce pay rates and gender distribution. The architecture integrates key AWS services such as S3 for data storage, AWS GlueDatabrew and Glue for cleaning, profiling and ETL processes.
### Figure 1. Design of the DAP

Note: Figure 1 represents the DAP for the dataset. The City of Vancouver’s HR Operation Team and the City of Vancouver’s HR end user will have access to the DAP using a specific virtual server (server=HSVS-Oma)- web server.  The COV HR End User and HR Data Team will have direct access to the DAP as shown in Figure 1. All elements in the design, such as the S3 Buckets, ETL pipeline, Catalog, functions, and usage, are explained in detail in the different phases (Steps 1 - 4) below. This design is continually scalable due to AWS’s scalable attributes.

## 🚪 Step 1. Dataset Ingestion
### Objective 
•	To ingest CSV file of the data into the AWS cloud
### Key AWS Service and Resources  
•	AWS S3 Bucket
### 🧭 Process
•	An S3 bucket titled ‘cov-raw-oma’ was prepared in AWS for the ingestion.

•	A subfolder titled hr was created. This is because the data is attributed to the COV Human Resources E.D.I.O Office.

•	The dataset titled “workforce_payrates_and_sex” in CSV format was uploaded directly into the prepared S3 bucket folder.

### Figure 2: Workforce Pay Rates and Sex CSV File Ingested into AWS S3 Bucket

Note: Figure 4 shows the completed ingestion of the City of Vancouver’s Government and Finance data set ‘workforce_payrates_and_sex’ into the S3 bucket ’cov-raw-oma’. The path is s3://cov-raw-oma/hr/year=2025/

### ⚖️ Justification
This was done to ingest the data into the AWS cloud storage for easy access, query, collaboration, analytical management, storage, security, and scalability of the WPRS data.
