# Project Title: Design and Implementation of DAP on AWS for the City of Vancouver

# Project Description
This project showcases the design and implementation of a Data Analytics Platform on AWS for the City of Vancouver (COV). The platform will be used to perform descriptive analysis, starting from data ingestion, processing, analytics, storage, and data summarization, leveraging AWS solutions offered through the AWS console. Additionally, the DAP is expected to leverage key attributes of the AWS space, such as dynamic scalability, availability, and self-tailored cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

# Methodology

i.	Design:  The DAP was designed as requested using Draw.io 

ii.	Data Ingestion: The subject data (WPRS) is ingested into the AWS S3 Raw bucket directly.

iii.	Data Profiling: This ingested dataset (WPRS) is profiled using AWS Glue DataBrew.

iv.	Data Cleaning: The phase transforms the profiled dataset from dirty to clean by removing any errors, such as missing or duplicate data, and structural issues. Output is saved in the AWS S3 Transform Bucket.

v.	Data Catalog:  Using Crawler on AWS Data Glue, a data catalog comprising schema and table location is created for the WPRS dataset to aid connectivity and data analytics.

vi.	Data Summarization: The dataset is summarized using metrics created in AWS Glue and stored in a system-friendly format with multiple partitions and a user-friendly format in a single file in AWS S3 Curated Bucket.
